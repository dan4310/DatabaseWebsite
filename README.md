# DatabaseWebsite
This is the code for a website I created to interact analysis with a few MLB databases. Databases that can be viewed include: people who work for the MLB, players batting stats, players fielding stats, players batting stats. These databases have records from as early as 1871 (MLB website only goes back as far as 1903) and as current as 2020. Currently only the batting and fielding pages have graphing capabilities.
